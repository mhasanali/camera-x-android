# camera-x-android
This app demonstrates a very simple use of the new CameraX API by Android Jetpack. The easy callbacks, Image processing and custom camera usage instead of handling it to the camera app. We can customize and use it as per our own requirements. Also, the scope of this project is not best practices, design patterns or architectures. Its just a stepping point to creating a custom camera using CameraX.
